# IMS (Inventory Management System)

## Project Overview
IMS (Inventory Management System) is a web-based application built using React to streamline inventory management. It helps users manage, track, and monitor their stock, ensuring accurate stock levels and easy recording of sales transactions. The system is designed to prevent overselling by validating stock quantities and auto-populating relevant fields based on item selection.

## Features
- **Item Management**: Manage your stock by adding, updating, and removing items.
- **Category-based Item Selection**: Use dynamic dropdowns for selecting item categories and items, which auto-populate fields like item quantity and category.
- **Stock Validation**: Prevents overselling by validating that the entered quantity does not exceed available stock.
- **Real-time Updates**: Reflects real-time stock data, updating after every sale.
- **Sell Records**: Easily create and track sell records, with features to view past sales.
  
## Tech Stack

- **Database**: MongoDB (you can modify based on your database)
